We are all still processing the news of J. Michael Reilly's death on March 13, 2021. A number of former students and colleagues are working on ideas to honor J. Michael Reilly's tremendous contribution to the community, including a memorial scholarship.

This website is a placeholder which we'll build out in the coming weeks.

In the meantime, please consider subscribing to the website mailing list to stay up to date with our plans.
